# Cursor Rules - Project Execution Guardrails

Reference: `AGENTS.md` is the canonical source of truth.

If any rule here conflicts with `AGENTS.md`, follow `AGENTS.md`.

## Mandatory
- For complex work, read `.sisyphus/plans/*.md` first.
- Do not make blind edits; follow plan-driven execution.
- Keep backend code ESM-only (`import/export`).
- Use async I/O (`fs.promises` / async child process wrappers).
- Respect recording concurrency locks (`LockManager`) before deletion operations.

## Verification Gate
- After edits, run syntax checks and relevant tests/build.
- Do not consider work complete without verification evidence.

## Git Gate
- After verification passes, commit and push immediately.
- Keep commits atomic and scoped.
- Local-only completion is allowed only when explicitly requested.
